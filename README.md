# ðŸ”¢ Fibonacci Sequence Generator (Java Console App)

This is a simple Java program that generates the **Fibonacci sequence** up to a user-defined number of terms.

The **Fibonacci sequence** is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

---

## ðŸ’¡ What This Program Does

- Accepts the number of terms from the user
- Generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to that term
- Uses a loop and basic variable swapping to build the series

---

## ðŸ“Œ Sample Input and Output

Please Enter term to generate 5 Fibonacci sequence for 5 is : 0 1 1 2 3

## ðŸ§  Logic Breakdown

### âž¤ Starting Values
```java
int a = 0, b = 1;
âž¤ Generating the Series

for (int i = 1; i <= term; i++) {
    System.out.println(a);
    int next = a + b;
    a = b;
    b = next;
}
Each loop:

Prints current value of a

Calculates the next term as a + b

Updates a and b for the next iteration

ðŸ›  Requirements
Java 8 or higher

A Java IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ, or the command line

ðŸš€ How to Run (In Eclipse)
Create a Java project and a class named Fibonacci inside package day6

Paste the code into your class file

Save and Run the program

Enter how many Fibonacci terms you'd like to generate when prompted

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

src/
â””â”€â”€ day6/
    â””â”€â”€ Fibonacci.java
ðŸ’¡ Possible Enhancements
Display Fibonacci numbers as a single line (instead of one per line)

Generate Fibonacci up to a maximum value, not just number of terms

Add input validation (e.g. prevent negative numbers)
